HANDIN: This is my final handin for Tetris

DESIGN CHOICES:		The PaneOrganizer classhis is the top level object. Here I create a 
						borderpane and add an instance of my Tetris game to it.
					The Tetris class contains all of the logic for my game, including clearing
						lines, moving pieces, making new pieces, a timeline, and key input
					The Piece class models all the things that each Tetris piece can do, like
						be created, rotate, move, and generate a random piece
					The Square class and is comprised of all the components/characteristics
						that each square in our board and pieces have. Like color, position,
						and status of whether or not it's part of the board.
